              <h1>Welcome</h1>
              <hr>
              <h4>Dear OSSB Marching Band Supporters:</h4>
              <p>What an experience! The Ohio State School for the Blind Marching Band performed their signature drill Script
                Braille "Ohio" while the Ohio State University Marching Band performed Script "Ohio" at the OSU-FAMU football
                game September 21, 2013 for a crowd of 105,000 fans! That portion of the half-time show was televised on
                the Big Ten Network! The visible message that there are no limitations on those with disabilities—who simply
                adapt, improvise and overcome—was viewed all over the nation.</p>

              <p>This incredible band band participated in the January 1, 2010 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California.
                That was a very exciting week that included going to The Ohio State University/Oregon University Rose Bowl
                game, participating in the Rose Bowl Bandfest Program and performing at the Music Center at Disneyland.</p>

              <p>On October 23rd, 2010 while performing at the Ohio State University Band skull session, the OSSB Marching Band
                was presented the prestigious National Citation award by the Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity. This award
                was given in recognition for outstanding achievement and contributions to the cause of music in America and
                setting new standards of excellence for persons with disabilities. On July 5, 2011, the OSSB Marching Band
                had the honor of being the lead marching band for the International Lions Convention Parade of Nations in
                Seattle, Washington.
              </p>

              <p>As we have done in the past the Ohio State School for the Blind Parent Teacher Staff Foundation (OSSBPTSF),
                has taken on the task of assisting the Marching Band to raise funds to support their very existence and to
                provide funds for activities and instruments, repairs, reeds, etc. for the students attending OSSB. OSSBPTSF
                is a non-profit corporation formed under Ohio Law, and is recognized as a tax exempt organization under 501(C)(3)
                of the Internal Revenue Code. Your donations will be strategically used to have the maximum impact on the
                programs that benefit the students at OSSB. Our present short-term goal is to provide $24,000 funding for
                the week-long band camp in August of 2014. The long-term goal is to create a $600,000 endowment to perpetuate
                band camp for years to come. Other costs include the need for more instruments, repair of many instruments,
                as well as replacement cases. Without funds the band cannot demonstrate the abilities of those with disabilities
                in venues outside of central Ohio.
